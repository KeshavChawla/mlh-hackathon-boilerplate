                            <p>A hackathon is an event in which groups of hackers divided into teams develop a product. Hundreds of programmers get together to build something from scratch, be it a website, app, or some other product of their imagination.
                                There will be lots of food and prizes, and opportunities to work with representatives from various companies.</p>
